GetTotalResistances = Please enter the total # of resistors in the circuit: 
GetResistancesHelp =  Please enter your list of resistances for the TOTALRESISTORS resistors you requested.\n\n\
					  \tFor example, 30 means R1 = 30 ohms. The resistor ID will be given in the order of your input.\n\
				      \tYou may add them in succession to quickly add the resistors. \n\n
CircuitConnectionHelp = \nPlease enter the list of IDs and the connection type in the format (ID1 ID2 IDN connection type). \n\n\
						\tFor example, \"1 5 7 Parallel\" means R1//R5//R7, for multi-layered circuits,\n\
						\tthis will automatically be referred to \"R157.\" Type 157 as an example,\n\
						\nPlease start from the innermost layer and work your way out to the outermost layer. Type \"next\" at\n\
						anytime between your input to indicate that you want to enter the next set of resistors in the next level.\n\n
