GetLoadType = Please enter the load type of your circuit (Resistor/Capacitor/Inductor): 
GetTotalLoad = Please enter the total # of LOAD objects in the circuit: 
GetLoadValue =  Please enter your list of LOADVALUEs for the TOTALLOAD LOADs you requested.\n\n\
					  \tFor example, 30 means L1 = 30 UNITS. The LOAD ID will be given in the order of your input.\n\
				      \tYou may add them in succession to quickly add the LOADs. \n\n
GetCircuitConnection = \nPlease enter the list of IDs and the connection type in the format (ID1 ID2 IDN connection type). \n\n\
						\tFor example, \"R1 R5 R7 Parallel\" means R1//R5//R7, for multi-layered circuits,\n\
						\tthis will automatically be referred to \"Rn+1.\" If there were 8 resistors in the circuit, this would be referred\n\
						\tas R8.\n\
						\nPlease start from the innermost layer and work your way out to the outermost layer. Type \"END\" at\n\
						anytime to finish connecting the loads to the circuit.\n\n

InputMessage = Your Input: 
SectionBreak = \n--------------------------------------------\n
LoadCalculationResults = \n... Setting up connections ...\n\
						  ... Calculating resistances ...\n\
						  Done!\n
VariousTypeNotSupported = Currently the program only accepts 1 load type.

NoDisplayError = No applicable result to be shown. Please re-build your circuit.
LoadTypeError = Please enter either \"Resistor, Capacitor, or Inductor\". 
ValueError = Please enter an integer.
ConnectionTypeError = Please choose Series or Parallel. You may also type \"Resistor\" to add an individual resistor. Type "END" to finish circuit connections.
ConnectionResponseError = Please Try Again. Use the following format : ID1 ID2 IDN connectionType. Type "END" to finish circuit connections.

ListLoad = Your circuit loads and values:
ListCircuit = Your circuit connections and equivalent values:
